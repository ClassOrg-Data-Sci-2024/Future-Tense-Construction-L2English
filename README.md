## Future-Tense-Construction-L2English

When forming the future tense in English, multiple constructions can be utilized to construct future tense. These two constructions are `will` (e.g. "I will walk") and `going to` (e.g. "I am going to walk"). This project analyzes what affects how English L2 learners construct future tense. With demographic and proficiency data, this project looks for trends and correlations in constuction preferences (Which of these two will learners optfor?)

The data used in this project is from the University of Pittsburgh English Language Institute Corpus ([PELIC](https://eli-data-mining-group.github.io/Pitt-ELI-Corpus/)). This is a corpus of written responses collected from an English Intensive program. The dates of collection range form 2005-2012. All data for this project was gathered from [PELIC's GitHub Data Repository](https://github.com/ELI-Data-Mining-Group/PELIC-dataset). The corpus consists of data from 1177 students, creating 46,230 tests, with 4,250,703 tokens. Notably, the texts were all tokenized and lemmatized (39,623 word types and 39,307 lemma types.)
