Analysis of how English L2 learners construct future tense in PELIC data


There are varying strategies for English L2 tense instruction. Formulating the future and future continuous tense in English requires construction that can require time to learn. With Pitt's English Language Institute Corpus ([PELIC](https://eli-data-mining-group.github.io/Pitt-ELI-Corpus/)), I propose investigating the correlation between future and Future continuous tense selection with proficiency metrics (test scores). This will be a targeted question, scoping to only future and future continuous tense. (This topic was inspired by a conversation and potential collaboration with another MA student.)
