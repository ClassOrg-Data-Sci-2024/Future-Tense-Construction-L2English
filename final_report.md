Final Report - Future Tense Construction Preference in L2 English Learners.pdf

## Introduction

The construction of the future tense in English is a curious topic. Indeed, there have been class for a re-analysis of English future tense (Huddleston 1995). Regardless, being able to express occurances will happen in the future remains an important part of a speakers linguistic capability. To this end, when teaching English as a Second Language, it is important to construct curriculum that will allow for the future tense to be expressed by those are learning English. This project is an corpus-based analysis on the effects of the speaker's proficiency on their preference for how the future tense is constucted.

## Background

### Literature Review

In a review of the construction of future tense in English, Berglund (2005) finds that there are five ways of constructing the future tense in Modern English:

-   `will`: "I will walk tomorrow."
-   \`'ll' : "I'll walk tomorrow."
-   `shall`: "I shall walk tomorrow."
-   `going to`: "I am going to walk tomorrow."
-   `gonna`: "I am gonna walk tomorrow."

Note that these constructions are directly indicating that the verb will take place in the future, so this will not investigate constuctsions like plan: "I plan to walk tomorrow." Research has been conducted in this area, finding that learners of English were over five times more likely to use the `will` construction than the `going to` construction. This is an interesting result, more so becuase it is also found that the `will` constuction emerges earlier than the `going to` constuction. This project seeks to address this questions and analyze the role of proficiency in students' preference for one construction or the other.

### Data

The data utilized to suggest an answer this question comes from the Univerity of Pittsburgh English Language Institute Corpus (PELIC). This corpus is a collection of written responses from 1177 students enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh's Intensive English Program from 2005 to 2012, in an English for Academic Purposes Context. The data comprises 46,230 texts and 4,250,703 tokens. Each text has been tokenized and lemmatized, according to the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus, 1999). This was done with python's NLTK library, as was Part-of-Speech tagging, utilizing the Penn Treebank POS tagset.

### Methods

As the goal of this project was to understand the role of proficiency in future tense constuction preference, the methods that were selected to capture the effects of proficiency score on whether a speaker would use `will` or `going to` in a particular token. That is, a token level analysis was conducted.

Profiency was measured with the following data (provided in the corpus dataset):
